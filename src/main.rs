//! This little demo assumes:

//! - The underlying idea of type state. If you are unfamiliar [this post][cb]

// We declare this module below the `main` function, and import all of its `pub`
// items so that they are available to use in `main`.
use state::*;

/// The overall flow through `main` here demonstrates a three-step state machine
/// where state can flow from `First` to `Second` to `Third`, can step back from
/// `Third` to `Second`, and can exit from the state machine entirely once in
/// the `Third` state.
///
/// The key difference from normal state machine implementations using an enum
/// is that the *variants* are only part of the story: the *state structs* they
/// wrap are the other half. Each variant is a tuple-style variant which
/// includes the
fn main() {
    // We're just using this for the sake of "logging" some output. Feel free to
    // ignore it!
    let mut step = 0;

    // Here is the meat of the demo: we create a `StateMachine`

    // Because we have a not made the internal values of the state structs in
    // the `state` module public, this is actually the only way to set up the
    // state machine! This gives us a useful hook for passing initial state into
    // the state machine.

        step += 1;

        // Now, because we have defined the `StateMachine` type so that each
        // variant wraps a "type state" (`First`, `Second`, and `Third`), we can
        // do normal pattern matching on its variants, but the transitions are
        // more or less predefined for us!
        match state_machine {
            // When we have an `A`, we can stay in the initial state, or we can
            // advance the machine to `Second` by using the public API provided
            // by `A` to get a `B`. Moreover, because `A` is *moved* into `B`,
            // once we are in `StateMachine::Second(B)`, we *cannot* go backward
            // using the public APIs we have defined.

    /// state machine, a caller can only (and must) use the API provided by each
    /// wrapped type to transition to another wrapped type.
